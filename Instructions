1)  Create a .txt containing the desired string to see whether the syntax is able to be compiled in our language
2)  Remember what you named your .txt file
3)  Use the name of your text file as the first argument when initialising the Parser
4)  If desired, use "error" as the second argument and the parser will tell the user what kind of terminals it expects when it encounters a syntax error in your string
